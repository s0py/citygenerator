# citygenerator
a python program that generates city names and details and prints them to a text file wherever you run it

you must have python 3 installed and the program is run from the command prompt

to run
1. make sure python 3 is installed
2. download this program (obviously you've done that already)
3. drag namegen.py to your desktop
4. open command prompt and type the text on the following line and hit enter
cd Desktop
5. this will have taken your to your desktop in command prompt so you can run python files from it
6. type the code on the following line into command prompt and hit enter
namegen.py
7. this should have mader a text file on your desktop called "Cities.txt"
8. open it and it will show you a description of a city, town, village, thorp, etc.

you can continue to run the program by either typing the command again or hitting the up arrow on your keyboard and then hitting enter
it will keep adding to the same text file.

i hope that the comments i left in the .py file are sufficient, if not, contact me on twitter @_s0py
